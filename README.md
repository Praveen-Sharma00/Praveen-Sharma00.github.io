# Tower_Of_Hanoi_Game

A Simple Game built in 2 hrs that still has a lot of glitches. 
Some of the glitches that I personally disliked are listed below


1) The Page isn't Responsive , or even if it's trust me the layout is horrible on Medium & Small Screens 
2) Some Error cases still have to be looked into
3) Less Interactivity 
4) Works only on chrome as it makes use of ES6 features supported only by chrome as of now ....

   and more to come from you ........... !
   
 It would be awesome to have good documentation !
